WeatherApp
WeatherApp is a simple multi-user weather application for tracking weather information of specified locations created using OpenWeatherMap API and Django.
 

 
    Overview
Semantics behind WeatherApp is based on a system where multiple users under management of an admin, can apply CRUD operations on specified locations to get the latest weather information about them.
Users can sign up to the system from the signup page (which is accessible through the login page) and get started using WeatherApp directly from the homepage.
In the home page users can display their current set locations along with their weather information as well as options for CRUD operations. Weather information that lies within the home page gets automatically updated for every minute.
